Custom Processing project utilizing an old MS Kinect device to track people passing a store front window.
When a target is aquired the projected eyes will follow the person's X-axis location until they are no loger able to be tracked.
After the target is lost the eyes will randomly gaze at other things until another target is in range of the sensor.
